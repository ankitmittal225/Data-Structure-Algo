/**
 * DP : 
 * In simple words, its an optimization over plain recursion
 * Idea of dynamic programming is to reuse the solution of subproblems when there are overlapping subproblem.
 * 
 * There are 2 ways to implement dynamic programming : 
 * 	-	memoization(Top-down)
 * 	-	Tabulation( Bottom-up)
 * 
 * Application : 
 * 	-	Bellman ford algorithms - algorithm to find shortest path from source to destination
 * 	-	Floyd warshall algorithms - shortest path between every pair of vertices in graph
 * 	-	Diff utility LCS(Longest commen subsequence)- file difference, version controlling
 * 	-	Search closed word(Edit Distance)
 * 	-	Resouce allocation (0-1 Knapsack)
